Full Stack Proxy
What is a Full Stack Proxy?
A full stack proxy is like a middleman that sits between the client (like your web browser) and the server (where your website’s data and functionality live). This middleman can handle requests and responses, making things smoother and more efficient.

Why Use a Full Stack Proxy?
Security: It can help protect your server from malicious attacks by hiding its details.
Load Balancing: It can distribute incoming requests evenly across multiple servers to ensure no single server gets overwhelmed.
Caching: It can store copies of frequently requested data to speed up response times.
Simplified Communication: It can manage the differences between different parts of your system, like handling API requests from a frontend to a backend server seamlessly.
How Does It Work?
Client Request: You type a URL in your browser and hit enter.
Proxy Server: The request first goes to the proxy server instead of directly going to the main server.
Processing: The proxy server processes the request (e.g., checking if it has a cached response or adding security headers).
Main Server: If needed, the proxy server forwards the request to the main server.
Response: The main server sends the response back to the proxy server, which might modify it slightly before sending it to you.
CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)
What is CORS?
CORS is a way for a server to tell browsers that it’s okay for web pages from different origins (i.e., domains) to request its resources.

Why is CORS Needed?
By default, for security reasons, browsers block web pages from making requests to a different domain than the one that served the web page. This is known as the Same-Origin Policy. CORS provides a way to relax this restriction.

How Does CORS Work?
Simple Request: For simple requests (like getting some data), the browser automatically adds an Origin header to the request.
Server Response: The server checks this header and, if it allows the request, sends back headers like Access-Control-Allow-Origin specifying which domains can access the resources.
Preflight Request: For more complex requests (like sending data with custom headers), the browser first sends an OPTIONS request to check if the server will allow it.
Preflight Response: The server responds with headers like Access-Control-Allow-Methods and Access-Control-Allow-Headers to indicate what’s allowed.
Example:
Your Website: https://mywebsite.com
API Server: https://api.anotherwebsite.com
If your website wants to get data from the API server, it sends a request. Without CORS, the browser would block this request. But if the API server has CORS configured to allow requests from https://mywebsite.com, it will send the appropriate headers back, and the browser will allow the request.

CORS Headers:
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: Specifies which origins can access the resource.
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: Lists the HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.) allowed.
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Lists the headers that can be used in the request.
Access-Control-Max-Age: Indicates how long the results of a preflight request can be cached.
Summary:
Full Stack Proxy: Acts as an intermediary to enhance security, efficiency, and manage communication between client and server.
CORS: A system that allows web pages from one origin to access resources from another origin, bypassing the same-origin policy for specific requests as defined by the server.
